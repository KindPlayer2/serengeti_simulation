# serengeti simulation

a simulation of the wildlife of the serengeti

there is a herd of Zebra that wander as boids, and stop to eat grass
They are chased by lions. once the lions are within range of the zebra they flee

one zebra will be pursued by the lion and the zebra will flee until caught

the rest will return to their boid wander state.

there are also elphants that wander with no input to the chain of the lions and zebras
